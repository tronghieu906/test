# Project Summary

This repository contains a small static-site scaffold built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed for simplicity and ease of use, with no build system or external dependencies by default.

## Key Features
- **Main Entry**: `index.html` (includes `css/style.css` and `js/main.js`).
- **Theming**: Supports light and dark themes, toggled via a button with state stored in `localStorage`.
- **JavaScript**: Uses an IIFE for theme toggling and DOM manipulation.
- **Preview**: Open `index.html` directly in a browser or use a local static server.
